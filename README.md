# binding-problem

## Purpose
I was feeling less than confident with event handlers in React so I did a bit of Googling. I found an article by Saurabh Misra on Free Code Camp which really cleared things up for me. After digesting the article I decided to write some quick example code with brief explainers for future reference.

The article: [Why Do We Need to Bind() Event Handlers in React?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/this-is-why-we-need-to-bind-event-handlers-in-class-components-in-react-f7ea1a6f93eb/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
